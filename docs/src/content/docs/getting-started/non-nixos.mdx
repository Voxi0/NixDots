:::caution
Window managers / Desktop environments installed by Nix can be a bit problematic on non-NixOS machines.
Using [nixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL) is an absolute must to avoid getting OpenGL errors
and such.

Hyprland is configured to work with [UWSM](https://github.com/Vladimir-csp/uwsm) so you are expected to
manually install that system package and all, reminder that it requires SystemD so OpenRC and other init
systems may not work properly.
:::

It's entirely possible to use all the Home Manager modules that are defined in NixDots as long as you have Nix
installed of course.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="flake.nix" icon="nix">
		<Code lang="nix" title={"flake.nix"} code={exampleFlake}/>
	</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="home.nix" icon="nix">
		<Code lang="nix" title={"home.nix"} code={exampleHome}/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
