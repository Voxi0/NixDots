:::caution
Window managers / Desktop environments installed by Nix can be a bit problematic on non-NixOS machines so
using [nixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL) is an absolute must to avoid getting OpenGL errors
and such.

Hyprland is configured to work with [UWSM](https://github.com/Vladimir-csp/uwsm) so you are expected to
manually install that system package and all, reminder that it requires SystemD so OpenRC and other init
systems may not work properly and shall also remain undocumented by me.
:::

It's entirely possible to use all the Home Manager modules that are defined in NixDots as long as you have Nix
installed of course.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="flake.nix" icon="nix">
		<Code lang="nix" title={"flake.nix"} code={exampleFlake}/>
	</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="home.nix" icon="nix">
		<Code lang="nix" title={"home.nix"} code={exampleHome}/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using WMs / DEs
I haven't tested any other Window Manager (WM) / Desktop Environment (DE) other than Hyprland thus far. But
I'm sure the things you need to do will be the same or very similar to what you have to do to run Hyprland.

### Hyprland
Install [UWSM](https://github.com/Vladimir-csp/uwsm) and [nixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL)
and then run `uwsm start $(nixGL hyprland)`.
