:::danger
Read the instructions very carefully as messing up something could cause a bunch of rather serious issues.
:::

## Fresh Install
<Steps>
	1. Download [NixOS](https://nixos.org/download/) and flash it to the installation media e.g. a USB drive
		I recommend using [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) for making a bootable USB drive
	2. Boot into the installation media and open the browser to this site to run the commands below after opening the terminal
	3. Run the following commands after carefully reading the instructions given before each of them
		```bash
		# Fetch NixDots and `cd` into it
		nix-shell -p git --run "git clone https://github.com/Voxi0/NixDots.git"
		cd NixDots

		# Configure some stuff e.g. username and keyboard layout
		# Nano is installed by default, use another editor if you want
		nano ./flake.nix

		# List all mounted disks to choose a disk to install NixOS on
		# Replace `<disk label/name>` with the name of the disk you wish to install NixOS on e.g. `/dev/sda`
		lsblk
		sudo nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run github:nix-community/disko -- -m disko --argstr device "<disk label/name>" ./disko.nix

		# !!IMPORTANT!!
		# Skipping this step will cause data loss among other not very nice things
		sudo nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config --root /mnt > hardware-configuration.nix
		mv hardware-configuration.nix hosts/<hostname>

		# Copy NixDots to the new system
		# Can be wherever you want, here we move it to just `/home` where all user home folders live
		sudo mkdir -p /mnt/home/NixDots
		cp -r ./* /mnt/home/NixDots/

		# Install NixOS - Replace `<hostname>` with the name of the host folder in `hosts/` to install
		# Just spam press `y` to accept everything e.g. binary caches and such - Without them installation will take hours
		sudo nixos-install --flake /mnt/home/NixDots/#<hostname>

		# Chroot into the new system to run additional commands like changing your password
		# Default password for any user is `nixos`
		sudo nixos-enter
		passwd <your_username>

		# Installation is complete! Power off and remove the installation media
		systemctl poweroff
		```
</Steps>

## On An Existing NixOS Installation
:::note
Always backup your current configuration and keep previous generations just in case you don't like NixDots
:::
<Steps>
	1. Just run the following commands in the terminal carefully
		```bash
		# Fetch NixDots and `cd` into it
		nix-shell -p git --run "git clone https://github.com/Voxi0/NixDots.git"
		cd NixDots

		# Configure some stuff like username, timezone, keyboard layout etc.
		# Nano is installed by default, use another editor if you want
		nano ./flake.nix

		# !!IMPORTANT!!
		# Skipping this step will cause data loss among other not very nice things
		sudo nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config --root /mnt > hardware-configuration.nix
		mv hardware-configuration.nix hosts/<hostname>

		# Rebuild the system - Update the flake if you desire but it may or may not break stuff
		# Replace `<hostname>` with the name of the host folder in `hosts/`
		# sudo nix flake update
		sudo nixos-rebuild boot --flake <path to NixDots>/#<hostname>

		# Reboot your system
		systemctl reboot
		```
</Steps>
