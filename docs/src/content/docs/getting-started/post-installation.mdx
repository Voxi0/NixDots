## Basics
<Steps>
	1. **Download NixDots (Fresh Install Only)**: If you did a fresh install of NixOS with NixDots, you've noticed we
		never actually moved NixDots to the fresh install. This is to keep the installation process simple. This is all
		you have to do now -
		```bash
		# Just clone NixDots and generate a `hardware-configuration.nix` for your current install/machine
		nix-shell -p git --run "git clone https://github.com/Voxi0/NixDots.git"
		cd NixDots
		sudo nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/<hostname>/hardware-configuration.nix
		```
	2. **Update the system**: [Nix Helper CLI](https://github.com/nix-community/nh) is installed by default.
		Update the system with `nh os boot <path to NixDots> -H <hostname> --update`. The `--update` flag updates the flake.
		Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/nix-community/nh) to learn more.
	3 **Set Timezone**: The timezone will default to UTC so set the correct timezone for you with the command
		`timedatectl set-timezone <timezone>`. The list of valid timezones can be found
		[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). This has to be done only once don't worry.
	4. **Gaming**: Run `flatpak update` to update [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/) which is the Roblox client I'm
	using here. It's only available as a Flatpak on Flathub sadly.
