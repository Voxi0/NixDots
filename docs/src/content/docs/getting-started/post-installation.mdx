## Basics
<Steps>
	1. **Update the system**: [Nix Helper CLI](https://github.com/nix-community/nh) is installed by default.
		Update the system with `nh os boot <path to NixDots> -H <hostname> --update`. The `--update` flag updates the flake.
		Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/nix-community/nh) to learn more.
	2. **Gaming**: Install Proton GE with the `protonup` command  to make most Steam titles playable and run `flatpak update`
		to update [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/) which is the Roblox client I'm using here. It's only available as a Flatpak
		on Flathub sadly.
