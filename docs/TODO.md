# TODO (Highest to Lowest Priority)
- [ ] Better README.md and documentation. Will attempt to document everything I can about NixDots.
- [ ] Add installation instructions. Installing NixDots is currently completely up to the user now which means they must be experienced. Obviously not a very good thing so will have to figure out the best way to make this easy to install.
- [ ] Refine [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) configuration. It's configuring many things that could be disabled with options leading to errors and such.
- [ ] Create my own [Neovim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) configuration with [NixCats](https://nixcats.org/) or configure [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) preset to my liking.
- [ ] Create options for all the CLI packages and all because most of them are just unnecessary or too niche.
- [ ] Graphical file manager for users who dislike using the terminal for navigation and such. Thunar is probably the way to go.
- [ ] Add Impermanence (To handle persistent state on systems with ephemeral root storage) and SOPS (For managing secrets).
