## NixDots
My personal NixOS and Home Manager dotfiles. Using Disko to declaratively partition disks which automates the install process
tremendously. Feel free to use my config however you like.

### Installing NixOS with NixDots
Just run this command to fetch NixDots and run the installer - <br>
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Voxi0/NixDots.git && cd NixDots && nix-shell ./install.nix
```
